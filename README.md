# Is this an image of a chat restriction warning?

## An image recognition function that given a screenshot, checks if the screenshot is a chat restriction warning. For discord bot.

When coding my discord bot, I wanted it to be able to extract text from screenshots of video games sent in chat, and react accordingly. As many screenshots were low quality, text extraction was proving difficult, so I experimented with the cv2 library on a particular case.

While limited in it's accuracy, it is able to recognise most of the time whether a screenshot is of a chat restriction warning. Included is also a .js file for calling it in JavaScript.
